# Cellular Automata Project: Lorenz 96 and Conway's Game of Life

## Overview
This repository contains my improved implementations of two significant cellular automata: Lorenz 96, a model simulating atmospheric turbulence, and Conway's Game of Life, a zero-player game demonstrating cellular automaton complexity. These implementations were part of an academic assignment aimed at learning modern programming methods and enhancing code quality, performance, and understanding of complex systems.

## Lorenz 96
The Lorenz 96 model is a simplified representation of atmospheric dynamics. It was initially devised by Edward Lorenz in 1996 to provide a more straightforward framework for studying atmospheric predictability and data assimilation. My implementation focuses on optimizing the model for efficiency and accuracy, making it suitable for various simulations and studies.

### Key Enhancements
- Data type optimization for increased calculation speed.
- Strategic use of vectorization to enhance performance.
- Memory management improvements to ensure efficient resource utilization.

## Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life is a famous cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. It consists of a grid of cells that live, die, or multiply based on a set of rules.

### Key Enhancements
- Modularization of code for better maintainability and readability.
- Optimized handling of edge cases and boundary conditions.
- Extensive testing and validation to ensure reliable performance.
